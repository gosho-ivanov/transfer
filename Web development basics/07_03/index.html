        Avenged Sevenfold is an American heavy metal band from California. The band is known for their diverse rock sound and dramatic imagery in album covers and merchandise.
        <br> They emerge with a metalcorte sound on their debut album <em style="color: violet;">Sounding the Seventh Trumpet</em> and largely continued this sound through their second album <em style="color: violet">Waking the Fallen</em>.
        <br> Their styled had evolved, however, by the time the 3<sup>rd</sup> album "City of Evil, into a more traditional heav metal style. They have, to this day, continued to use this style, albeit with a lot of experimenting.
        <br> This is especially true with their latest, 8<sup>th</sup> album <em style="color: violet ">Life Is But A Dream...</em>, a highly experimental record.
